- 👋 Hi, I’m @garydavenport73
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, JavaScript and making software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software engineering at West Virginia Northern Community College as a sophomore.  I have a degree in physics and a medical degree.
- 💞️ In these repositories you'll find some python projects that allow for cross-platform sound utilization.  You'll find a module that allows for flow layout in python.  I am very interested in building desktop or single page applications that do not require any host-interaction.  I've built a SQL parser and library that allows web application data to be stored in the web page itself.  I'm also making a linux tool which merges Puppy Linux versions with more familiar menuing and program categories.  
- Overall, I intend to really develop my "Single Page Application Including Data" which essentially stores its own database in a hidden div on the page itself. This allows the building of truly cross platform applications without any external dependencies (like NodeJS) and allows for persistence among sessions.  At the same time, GUI building is a cinch as this comes so naturally with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

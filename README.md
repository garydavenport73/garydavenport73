- 👋 Hi, I’m @garydavenport73
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, JavaScript and making software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software engineering at West Virginia Northern Community College as a sophomore.  I have a degree in physics and a medical degree.
- 💞️ In these repositories you'll find some python projects that allow for cross-platform sound utilization.  You'll find a module that allows for flow layout in python.  I am very interested in building desktop or single page applications that do not require any server-interaction.  I've built a SQL parser and library that allows web application data to be stored in the web page itself.  I'm also making a Linux tool which merges Puppy Linux versions with more familiar menuing and program categories.
